## HPE Global Header Example

The [Global Header](/templates/global-header), also known as the HPE Common Header and Footer Web Service, provides a tunable, yet consistent header to be used across all HPE applications.


### Header Guidelines

- Global Header should be on all applications and websites.
- Allows users to move between top-level important destinations.
- Located at the top of all applications and websites.

<Example 
  previewWidth="xlarge"
  height="xsmall"
  plain
>
  <DiagramPreview
    src={{
      dark: "/templateImages/globalheader-full.svg", 
      light: "/templateImages/globalheader-full.svg"
    }}
    alt="HPE Global Header"
  />
</Example>

## Persistent Sidebar

**Important note: The sidebar component will likely be deprecated from the HPE Design System by end of 2022.**

- Provides navigation to top level pages.
- Always placed below the [Global Header](/templates/global-header).
- Note that it was determined in a [September 2021 user study](https://hpe.sharepoint.com/teams/hpe-design/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2Fhpe%2Ddesign%2FShared%20Documents%2FHPExs%20Research%2FProjects%2FTransformation%20Office%2FUnlimited%20Studies%20%2D%20CCP%20UCEP%2FUnlimited%20Study%20%233%20%20HFS%20Navigation%20Study%2FHPE%20%2D%20HFS%20Vision%20Test%201%20Study%2Epdf&parent=%2Fteams%2Fhpe%2Ddesign%2FShared%20Documents%2FHPExs%20Research%2FProjects%2FTransformation%20Office%2FUnlimited%20Studies%20%2D%20CCP%20UCEP%2FUnlimited%20Study%20%233%20%20HFS%20Navigation%20Study&p=true&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9ocGUuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vOmI6L3QvaHBlLWRlc2lnbi9FV2E3SnppQjRLSklsRW1Nc04xMjNhZ0JRWlhxMFZvTTc0VDlGLVpOUThEdzNRP3J0aW1lPTdOOS00eHlUMlVn) that navigating between services using a Sidebar was not as seamless or clear when compared to other navigation models.

## Tabs Example

Tabs are a persistent horizontal bar that is used to navigate between related content without leaving the current page. See the [Tabs page](/components/tabs) for more guidance and examples.

### Tabs guidelines

- Use only nouns or verbs for labels.
- Use concise 1-2 word labels.
- Use sentence case (the first letter is a capital and the following are lowercase).
- Avoid nested tabs.
- Organize information by priority and the users' reading direction (e.g., left to right).
- Ensure first tab is active when arriving at the page.
- Keep users on same page when navigating between tabs.
- Use 5-7 tabs max.

<Example 
  caption="Diagram illustrating how tabs can provide side-to-side navigation between various sets of related content."
  previewWidth="medium"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
  plain
>
  <DiagramPreview
    src={{
      dark: "/templateImages/tab-nav-invert.svg", 
      light: "/templateImages/tab-nav.svg"
    }}
    alt="Diagram illustrating how Tabs can provide side-to-side navigation between various sets of related content."
  />
</Example>

<TabCaption />

export const data = {
  Tabs: 'Tabs are lateral sections that control which content you see.',
  Interaction: 'Click and reveal content.',
  Content:
    'Related content that can be divided into sections to present information within the same page.',
};

export const TabCaption = () => (
  <NameValueList
    layout="grid"
    pairProps={{ direction: 'column' }}
    columns={['medium', 'medium']}
  >
    {Object.entries(data).map(([name, value]) => (
      <NameValuePair key={name} name={name}>{value}</NameValuePair>
    ))}
  </NameValueList>
);
