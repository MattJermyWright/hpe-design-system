## Guidelines for Constructing Good Messaging

The following are some high-level guidelines for constructing good messaging:

- Use HPE's voice and tone
  - Conversational American English
  - Correct grammar and punctuation
  - Active tense
  - Human and approachable, not robotic sounding
  - Positive, "yes we can," not negative
  - Never condescending
- Write for all reading levels
  - To ensure clear, straightforward and efficient communication, a good benchmark to consider while writing is a United States grade 7 reading level. Check for grade reading level using an app like [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).
- Respect the user and their time
  - Establish context
  - Lead with what is most important
  - Explain using terminology consistent with the UI
  - Point the user directly to a resolution. Do not use "_contact your
    administrator_" or "_contact HPE_" &mdash; the administrator is likely
    the user and the support contact could be a channel partner. Instead,
    provide a direct means to connect the user with the party able to resolve
    the issue.
- Inspire trust and confidence
  - Use informative, concise language
  - State facts without coloring them in opinions
  - Avoid charged words such as "_error_"
  - Focus on the solution, avoid casting blame on the user or software
  - Focus on what is needed to be accomplished, avoid personal pronouns
    (e.g. I, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, them)
- Ensure the voice is human and humane
  - Read your message out loud to another person. Is this how you would say it out loud? Does the other person feel this is how two people would converse?

## Conversational American English

Variations of English are used throughout the world. However, to maintain consistency
in HPE's voice, the messaging standard is to use conversational American English.

Below are common usage and spelling differences between American, Indian,
and British English and suggested resolutions for where differences arise.

### British English

When there is a difference between American and British spelling, use the American spelling.

Many British words are spelled ending in "our" such as "colour". Use the American "or" variant instead: color.

Many British words are spelled ending in "yse" (analyse) or "ise" (realise). Use the American "yze"/"ize" variants instead: analyze/realize.

Additional common differences:

| British   | American  |
| --------- | --------- |
| Licence   | License   |
| Cancelled | Canceled  |
| Centre    | Center    |
| Catalogue | Catalog   |
| Behaviour | Behavior  |
| Favourite | Favorite  |
| Grey      | Gray      |
| Chips     | Fries ðŸ˜Š  |
| Biscuit   | Cookie ðŸ˜Š |

When using a spelling/grammar checker, set your locale to provide American English suggestions.

### Indian English

This is a collection of common words or phrases used in India, that are not used in American English:

| If you find yourself using thisâ€¦ | Example                                                                                | Use this instead                                                                                                                                                      | Why?                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sorted                           | _The feature is not sorted._                                                           | Use either "elaborated", "thought through", "analyzed", "planned".                                                                                                    | Confusing. "Sorted" implies sorting in the computer sense.     |
| Thus / Hence                     | _â€¦, thus you must factory reset._                                                      | Use "therefore".                                                                                                                                                      | Uncommon or too formal.                                        |
| Do the needful                   | _The server is down. Do the needful._                                                  | This is similar to "do what is necessary" or "do whatever it takes", but neither should be used in our messaging. Instead, be specific about what the user should do. | Never used. We should always be specific.                      |
| We will revert back              | I send an email saying "do it like this" and you reply, _Thanks, we will revert back._ | _We will get back to you._                                                                                                                                            | "Revert back" implies going back to a previous revision.       |
| Strong all the more              | _makes the case strong all the more._                                                  | _makes the case stronger._                                                                                                                                            | Never used.                                                    |
| I have a doubt                   | _I have a doubt about that._                                                           | _I have a question_                                                                                                                                                   | "I have a doubt about that" implies you think it is incorrect. |

## Point of View

Point of view is the perspective from which the message is written.
First person perspective uses words like: I, me, us, we, our, etc.
Second person uses any form of the word "you" which has the effect of
addressing the reader. Third person directs the reader to things that are
neither the writer or the reader.

Examples:

- _We noticed the server is malfunctioning._ (1st person-ish)
- _Your server is malfunctioning._ (2nd person-ish)
- _The server is malfunctioning._ (3rd person - no focus on the writer or the reader)

## Referring to support

- Do not tell the user to contact their administrator. The user is likely the administrator.
- Do not tell the user to contact HPE. A 3rd party may be providing support to the user.
- Use something like: _Contact your authorized support representative._
- Do not overuse this phrase. If the resolution to a problem is clear, just give the resolution and do not add that the user should contact support.
- Contacting support costs everyone time and money, so do not turn every issue into a potential support issue. It makes our product seem unnecessarily fragile and can result in unnecessary support calls.
- Do use this phrase for internal errors where there's nothing else the user can do (i.e. when it is the only resolution).

## Scale

Consider singular and plural use cases and craft messages for each.

If a sentence contains a list, do not allow the length of the list to be unbounded. Instead, consider a construct where three items are shown and the remaining item are grouped: _The following policies have not been implemented: Policy A, Policy B, Policy C, and 5 others._
