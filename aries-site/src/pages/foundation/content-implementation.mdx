## Localization

A best practice for developers is to add comments to messages in the properties files or message catalogs. Reviewers and translators (and ultimately, users) will thank you.

- Document all parameter substitution values. When the value is a resource, be specific. Is it a name? Is it a URI? Is it raw JSON that needs to be encapsulated in curly braces? Or is it pre-formatted JSON that includes curly braces?
- For errors and alerts, document the severity associated with the message.
- Document the type of message (alert, task, etc).
- If the message doesn't document (for the user) full details of how this problem occurs or what to do about it, add the details in comments.
- Some context around the task being performed or the resource category involved is useful.
- Is the message an API-only message (does not appear in the UI)? If yes, document it as such.

## User Input

Unless there is a compelling reason, do not limit the character set that a user can use to name things. Names commonly contain non-alphanumeric characters and we must handle them correctly on input and in re-display via messaging. For example:

- _Joe’s system_ (apostrophe for a possessive)
- _O’Reilly Auto Parts_ (apostrophe in name)
- _Yahoo! Client_ (company name includes a symbol)
- _Frank James-Martin_ (Hyphen in name)
- _DC-NY-East_ (Dashes in internal company identifiers)
- _Björk Guðmundsdóttir_ (Unicode characters)
- _联想_ (Unicode characters)
- _John Q. Public_ (punctuation for abbreviation)
- _“”>_ (An actual company name in the UK that the UK Companies House had to ban because it broke their systems. See [article](https://idle.slashdot.org/story/20/11/08/2334254/uk-agency-demands-company-stop-using-name-which-includes-an-html-closing-tag).)

Proper encoding/decoding of user-entered input must be performed to prevent SQL/XSS attacks. Input such as the following user input must not cause problems when the user-generated input is later incorporated in application messaging:

- _Robert’); DROP TABLE Students;--_ (see: [https://xkcd.com/327/](https://xkcd.com/327/))

User-generated input can be arbitrarily long. When confronted with displaying user-generated input, plan for the 80% case, but define which of truncation (with hover) or wrapping will be used.

## Maintainability

A best practice for developers is to use parameter substitution in messaging where
branded names occur.

A product's branding is likely to evolve over time. For example, GreenLake Central
recently rebranded as Cloud Services. Imagine the multitude of instances to which
the product name was referred. Use of parameter substitution limits the number changes to
be made while ensuring brand names are spelled and capitalized consistently in all
messages. Implementing messages with a parameterized `${prodname}` instead of
hardcoded messages allows for a product's branding to be changed easily,
confidently, and comprehensively.
Lastly, consider formal and informal substitution values which can be used in
various contexts. For example:

- formal = HPE Ezmeral Container Platform
- normal = Ezmeral Container Platform
- short = Container Platform
