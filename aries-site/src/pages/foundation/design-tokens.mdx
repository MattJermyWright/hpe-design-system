Implementing design tokens are an efficient way for HPE’s design system teams, product teams, and users of HPE’s design tools, to maintain consistency across digital products.

## What are design tokens?

Design tokens are a way to standardize and centralize design language used in creating digital products. Tokens use self-explanatory names to represent values, including but not limited to: colors, typography, spacing.

By using design tokens, designers and developers can ensure consistency in the look and feel of all elements across various platforms and devices.

An HPE Design Token consists of two main components:

1. A self-explanatory name that represents the coded value: “color.background”.
2. An associated value: #01A982.

<Example>
  <SimpleToken />
</Example>

## Why are design tokens important?

Tokens provide consistency throughout the brand and are a single source of truth for designers and developers. It provides a tech-stack agnostic way for a variety of teams to quickly get “on brand”.

Implementing design tokens allows designers and developers to quickly and efficiently make system-wide updates and changes to design elements, without having to do it manually.

Because design tokens provide a common language for designers and developers, it promotes communication, collaboration, and reduces the risk of errors. As products and services grow at HPE, tokens allow for ease of scalability, providing a flexible framework that can adapt to changing needs and requirements.

## How to read tokens

The hierarchy of a token is read in a left-to-right order, going from general to specific.

### Token naming structure

The structure of the token naming schema intends to:

1. First, establish the subject of the token (a color, a dimension such as spacing, a component such as button)
2. Specify the variant and state of the subject
3. Identify the CSS property to be affected and any breakpoint-specifications

### Possible facets of a token name

| Facet              | Definition                                                                                                            | Examples                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Group/Component | The subject of the token.                                                                                             | color, input, anchor, button                      |
| 2. Element         | A sub-component or specific element in a component.                                                                   | icon, label                                       |
| 3. Concept         | A semantic concept, often used to define categories of color tokens.                                                  | background, border, validation                    |
| 4. Size            | The t-shirt size of the component.                                                                                    | xsmall, small, medium                             |
| 5. Variant         | A specific variant of a component.                                                                                    | For button, primary/secondary. For heading, 1/2/3 |
| 6. State           | The interaction state of the component. "Enabled" is considered the default state and is not included in token names. | disabled, hover, focus                            |
| 7. Breakpoint      | The specific breakpoint to apply the style.                                                                           | mobile, tablet, desktop                           |
| 8. CSS Property    | The specific CSS property to be styled. Use camelCase.                                                                | color, fontSize, borderRadius                     |
| 9. Mode            | The theme mode. Mode should be defined on "color" tokens only.                                                        | light, dark                                       |

### Example token names

| Token                                 | Group/Component | Element | Concept    | Size  | Variant | State | Breakpoint | CSS Property | Mode  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------- | ---------- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------ | ----- |
| **color.background.front.light**      | color           | --      | background | --    | front   | --    | --         | --           | light |
| **radius.full**                       | radius          | --      | --         | --    | full    | --    | --         | --           | --    |
| **input.borderRadius**                | input           | --      | --         | --    | --      | --    | --         | borderRadius | --    |
| **anchor.icon.color**                 | anchor          | icon    | --         | --    | --      | --    | --         | color        | --    |
| **button.large.primary.borderRadius** | button          | --      | --         | large | primary | --    | --         | borderRadius | --    |
| **heading.1.mobile.fontSize**         | heading         | --      | --         | --    | 1       | --    | mobile     | fontSize     | --    |
| **button.default.hover.background**   | button          | --      | --         | --    | default | hover | --         | background   | --    |

### Rules and best practices

1. The “Group/Component” is required to establish the subject of the token.
1. For component tokens, the “CSS property” is required to establish what style is affected.
1. “Mode” should only be used on raw “color” tokens. When referencing colors at the component level, the component token should reference a color token.
1. A token does not need to include a value for every possible facet. In fact, you should use the minimum number of facets possible.
1. For “State”, “enabled” is considered the default state and should not be included in the token name. Only modifiers like “hover”, “disabled”, “focus”, etc. should be used.

## Current progress

We’re excited to announce that we’re implementing design tokens as part of the HPE Design System. We would appreciate any feedback you might have, visit our [Github]() and [Slack channel]() to leave us any comments or questions.

### Global tokens

Global tokens define the base for all components styles by establishing the available breakpoints, colors, elevation, rounding, spacing, and sizing values.

#### H1 fontSize tokens

| Token                          | Value | Example                              |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| **heading.1.desktop.fontSize** | 36px  | <HeadingToken />                     |
| **heading.1.tablet.fontSize**  | 24px  | <HeadingToken breakpoint="tablet" /> |
| **heading.1.mobile.fontSize**  | 20px  | <HeadingToken breakpoint="mobile" /> |

The full set of global tokens can be found in the [hpe-design-tokens global.json](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-tokens/blob/main/global.json) file.

### Component tokens

Component tokens define specific styling for aspects of a component.

#### Anchor tokens

| Token                     | Value                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **anchor.color**          | color.text.strong      |
| **anchor.textDecoration** | underline              |
| **anchor.fontWeight**     | font.medium.fontWeight |
| **anchor.icon.color**     | color.brand            |

The full set of component tokens can be found in the [hpe-design-tokens components.json](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-tokens/blob/main/components.json) file.

## How to use tokens

### Figma

TBD.

### Code

If you are building with grommet-theme-hpe and Grommet, no changes are need on your end. You're getting the tokens out of the box because grommet-theme-hpe is built using HPE Design Tokens.

If you are not building with grommet-theme-hpe and Grommet, you can access the design tokens on Github under [hpe-design-tokens](). This repository exports a variety of versions of the tokens for ease-of-use depending on your styling approach. For example, a [JSON file with resolved token values]() is exported as well as a file with [CSS variables]().
