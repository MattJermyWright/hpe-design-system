## Capitalization

The general rule is that things that are sentences should follow sentence capitalization rules. And, things that are titles/headings/labels should follow title capitalization rules.

Sentences follow sentence capitalization rules:

- Paragraphs of text
- Tips
- Notifications
- Help

Titles follow title capitalization rules:

- Page/dialog titles
- Section headings
- Attribute labels
- Table column headings
- Legends
- Tabs/Buttons

Capitalize proper nouns. HPE brand and product names are proper nouns.

Fight the urge to elevate normal nouns to proper noun status. For example, if you are in a "data sources" page and need to say something about data sources, do not capitalize it. Unless it is a true proper noun, leave it uncapitalized when following sentence capitalization rules.

DO NOT USE ALL CAPS IN EITHER TITLES OR SENTENCES. It is harder to read and is equated with yelling.

## Acronyms & Initialisms

Acronyms and initialisms can be problematic and should be used with care.
Because they are shortcuts communicating a concept in a visually shortened form, they
tend to become distinct languages for a limited set of "insiders."
However, for those who are less fluent or use the language infrequently,
acronyms and initialisms are actually detrimental. Acronyms increase the cognitive load
on the user, forcing them to "decode" the message before comprehension, and tend to
be exclusionary rather than inclusive.
If an acronym or initialism is needed, define it the first time it is used.
Additionally, only use the acronym if it is used multiple times in the message.

- Incorrect: _The UBC is meeting tomorrow._
- Incorrect: _The UBC (University Building Council) is meeting tomorrow._
- Incorrect: _The University Building Council (UBC) is meeting tomorrow._
- Correct: _The University Building Council (UBC) is meeting tomorrow. If you
  have UBC-related business, send it to the UBC administrator for addition to
  the meeting agenda._

## Branding

To aid in comprehension, do not use full brand/product names in messaging. Refer to these with shortened names. For example, "_HPE GreenLake Lighthouse_" is a mouthful and if needed several times in a sentence, set context and consider using a simpler "_Lighthouse_" the second, third, Nth time.

## Language Dos and Don'ts

**Do this:**

- Use words like "a", "an", "the" so we don't sound like a robot.
- Add punctuation to the end of each sentence.
- Use correct punctuation within a sentence.
- Feel free to use contractions.
- Adjectives typically come before nouns.
  - Incorrect: _the operation specified is…_
  - Correct: _the specified operation is…_
- Adjectives in English appear in a specific order. If this order is violated, the sentence will seem odd.
  - From the book *The Elements of Eloquence*: ...adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-color-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac. It’s an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out.
  - There's a slightly different order listed in the Cambridge Dictionary.
  - Therefore: _two failing SATA SSD drives_ and not _SSD SATA failing two drives_

**Don't do this:**

- Avoid possessives (e.g. _the server hardware's power is off_).
- Eliminate run-on sentences.
- Don't overuse the word "please".  While "please" is allowed, starting every action phrase with the word "please" is not appropriate.  In general, we should be limiting the use of "please".
- When the subject of a sentence is a specific resource, do not use that resource’s name as an adjective describing a resource type.  Instead, use the type as an adjective describing the resource:
  - Incorrect: _the ABC uplink set has…_
  - Correct: _the uplink set "ABC" has…_
- It is not necessary to tell the user to _retry the operation_ in most cases.  For example, if the user has entered incorrect or illegal values, we only need to tell them to specify correct values and do not also need to tell them to retry the operation.  The retry is intuitive and obvious in these cases.
- Never tell the user to retry after _some time_.  Be more specific.
  - E.g. "_after 3 minutes_" or "_after the refresh has completed."_
- Don't tell the user to _try_ or _attempt_ things. It does not convey confidence. Instead, tell them to do things.
  - Incorrect: _Try resetting the interconnect._
  - Correct: _Reset the interconnect._
- Don't say _bad request_. This is blaming the user.  Just explain what is wrong.
- Do not use internal terminology in external messaging.
- Do not refer to "the" or "your" administrator in messaging.  More often than not, the user reading the message is the administrator. Be more specific.
- When making parenthetical comments…
  - Don’t add spaces inside the parentheses: _this is bad ( yes it is )._
  - Do add spaces outside the parentheses: _this is bad(yes it is)._ The exception would be things like “server(s)”.
- Avoid incorrect use of the word "input".
  - Incorrect: _Specify a valid certificate as input._
  - Correct: _Specify a valid certificate._
  - Incorrect: _One of the input parameters is null._
  - Correct: _One of the parameters is null._ or _One of the specified parameters is null._ or _The "name" parameter is null._

## Miscellany

### Quoting

In messaging that contains user-specified content, use double-quotes around this content if it is not rendered as a hyperlink. If user-content is rendered as a hyperlink, the hyperlink styling is sufficient to offset the content from other text in the message.

Why is this important? User-entered names can contain spaces, and if they are not quoted or rendered as hyperlinks, they can hinder comprehension of a message.

Here is a correct example: _the uplink set "{0}" has a problem_. Compare this to an incorrect example: _the uplink set {0} has a problem_. If the uplink set is named "deleted", this will read as _the uplink set deleted has a problem_.

## Other Common Problems and How To Address Them

The following are commonly misspelled/mis-capitalized terms:

- The following must be spelled/capitalized as shown:
  - Kubernetes
  - Ethernet
  - Fibre Channel
  - FCoE
  - SNMP, SNMPv3
  - ID (not id or Id)
  - OK (not ok, Ok, or okay)
  - I/O (not IO or i/o)
  - API (not xApi) (either that, or be explicit and say X-API-Version)
- "Log in" is a verb (e.g. "Log in to the server").
- "Login" is a noun or adjective (e.g. "The login token has expired").
- Use the word "and" instead of an ampersand "&".
- Filesystem is one word.
- Use "host name" when referring to the name of a host.
- Use "hostname" when referring to the Unix command.

| try again / retry operation (when used as the sole recommended action) | Tell the user what they need to change and then tell them to try again. | At minimum, each instance needs to be evaluated more deeply to see what our code could do to prevent the user from doing something we could do ourselves.  If a retry is due to a timeout (proxy, etc), then first see if the code can be changed to use an exponential backoff algorithm to do its own retries.  Any time that retry will be used in messaging, the message itself needs more explanation for what actually went wrong.                                                       |

A dialog is a pop-up (sidebar, central, full-page) that overlays a page and typically results from the user performing an action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

However, it is even better to use neither and instead be specific about what the problem is. For example, if an input is not valid because it is too long, then tell the user the input is too long instead of telling them it is not valid.

Good example: "Retry the operation. If the problem persists, contact your authorized support representative and provide a support dump". In general, each separate option in an error resolution should be either, its own sentence, or in a comma separated list. The last-resort action of contacting support must always be in its own sentence. |
