One of the centerpieces of any branding is the logo; at HPE it is known as the "Element." The Element is about focus. It creates momentum and energy. It is a building block. It can move, change, expand, and constrain. It works across many touch points.


The Element speaks to our focus on
customers and their success, with a color which signals growth and
opportunity, and an approachable word-mark which says we are welcoming
to our partners.

This foucs is also imbued in Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company,
a leading provider of next-generation networking solutions for
enterprise. Aruba's cloud-first approach is part of HPE's effort to help
our partners address the fundamental changes in today's business
environment.

All usage of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise brand elements is
subject to the requirements and restrictions
outlined in the [Terms of Use](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/about/legal/terms-of-use.html).
For additional guidance see [Brand Central](https://brandcentral.hpe.com/home).

## Hewlett Packard Enterprise
