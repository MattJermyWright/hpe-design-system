Messaging within HPE applications should be informative, concise, and trustworthy.
It should be delivered in active, positive, objective, conversational
American English and written from a third-person [point of view](#point-of-view).
Executed properly, messaging within HPE applications should leave users
feeling and perceiving HPE and its products to be intelligent, experienced,
inclusive, and trustworthy.

## Messaging Voice, Tone, and Content

Many definitions for tone and voice exist, however, reading through the
various definitions, a common picture emerges:

| Voice                         | Tone                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Who they hear                 | What they hear                              |
| Personality                   | Attitude                                    |
| How you are doing the writing | Who they hear                               |
| Style                         | How your message comes across               |
| What makes us uniquely us     | How we communicate to our specific audience |

### Voice

Voice is who the reader "hears" delivering messaging; embedded within it is the
worldview of the author. Voice can be spoken, witty, friendly, formal, etc.
At HPE, the desire is for HPE's voice to be perceived as intelligent, experienced,
objective, inclusive, and trustworthy; supporting HPE's worldview which
believes in accelerating what's next, making bold moves, the power of _yes we can_, and
being a force for good.

A person's voice typically does not change once established. If HPE's voice is
inconsistent, people will notice. For example, people notice the difference
between writing academically when compared to sounding like a 5-year old. This
kind of inconsistency can result in lack of trust.

### Tone

Tone has to do with what is conveyed or how it comes across. It can express seriousness, urgency, playfulness, objectivity, intimacy, condescension, etc.

Unlike voice, tone can change based on the target audience, context, and subject
matter. It is situational. For example, tone is very different when giving
directions during an emergency compared to when ordering a pizza.

Because tone is situational, it may be tweaked to appropriately fit the context
within an HPE application. While tone may change, the message should be consistently
delivered in [HPE's voice](#voice) supporting the perception of intelligence,
experience, objectivity, and inclusivity.
