You will notice that the HPE Design System Color guidance is
different from Brand Central's. Prioritize the below HPE Design
System color palette over Brand Central when identifying colors
for your app or web-based experience.

## Color Palettes

Color is a key way we express our brand. It is also key in inclusive design, which is an HPE goal. Color, combined with typography, how we display data, and even the colors we use in light and dark mode are purposeful choices towards branding and inclusive design.  

### Brand Color

HPE green symbolizes growth and vitality, commands attention, and
inspires action. Our green is an essential part of our brand
identity and should be evident in every communication wherever
possible. Always use the custom color specifications seen here
to maintain consistency across channels and media.

<BrandColor />

### Core Palette

HPE Core colors provide a set of swatches that complement HPE
Green and help establish the vibrant experience HPE embraces. We
use "emphasis" as a way to show the importance and use the most
vibrant hue on light or dark contexts. Avoid pairing colors in the palette with Core colors that are close in tone/hue because they might not create enough of a contrast to meet accessibility standards.

<CorePalette />

### Light Palette

The light color palette provides a set of swatches which
complement HPE Core colors for use in combination with dark text
to maintain color accessibility in your experience. Use these
colors only when implementing a light theme.

<LightPalette />

### Dark Palette

The dark color palette provides a set of swatches which
complement HPE Core colors for use in combination with light
text to maintain color accessibility in your experience. Use
these colors only when implementing a dark theme.

## Green Color Accessibility

The HPE Design System green <ColorSwatch background="green" /> ensures compliance with WCAG 2.1
standards for distinguishable text and color ([see success criterion 1.4.1 and 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#distinguishable)). 
With accessibility as one of its core principles, the HPE
Design System focused on keeping accessibilty research and
guidelines at the center of its color selection process. We aim for AAA, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines' (WCAG) most accessible compliance level.

See details below on how to remain compliant in both light and
dark theme modes.

### Light Mode

AAA compliance is met for text on a light mode green background
when using `text-strong` <ColorSwatch background={{color: "text-strong", dark: false}} /> color. This is ensured for text of size
18px and above.

If a font size is below 18px, AAA compliance will fail with
default font weight on an HPE `green` <ColorSwatch background={{color: "green", dark: false}} /> background. In this case,
apply `weight="bold"` to meet the AAA compliance.

<LightModeContrast />

### Dark Mode

AA compliance is met for text on a dark mode `green` <ColorSwatch background={{color: "green", dark: true}} /> background
when using `text-strong` <ColorSwatch background={{color: "text-strong", dark: true}} /> color. To meet AAA compliance, use text
`size="large"` and `weight="bold"`.

## Background Colors

Our color palette is only impactful when used in the correct
context. Make sure to incorporate dark mode using the the appropriate color palette for a
successful customer experience.

For more direction on how to use background colors within your
layout, see [Background Colors Guidance](/foundation/background-colors-guidance).

### Background Palette

Build depth and contrast in both light and dark modes between the background and interface elements (i.e. typography, links, buttons, and other interactive elements) for readability and to ensure driving users' success through your workflow. The swatches below illustrate how to use color for your experiences.

<BackgroundLight />  
<br />
<BackgroundDark />

### Contrast

When you have more than two layers of content (e.g. a
background and a styled UI element on top of it), you can use
contrast to help add more layers of depth to your design,
illustrate a visual separation, or show how stacked interface
elements will look. By default, contrast will bump your
background to a lighter or darker tint based on the theme and
background.

<ContrastLight />

<ContrastDark />

## Border Colors

Using border colors properly ensures that the user is able to
identify the state of various components. Borders help
differentiate elements and input fields from surrounding
content.
                          
### Border Palette

In light and dark modes, border is key in making separating
input fields or layout elements from surrounding content.
Depending on the context, a varying amount of strength is needed
for the border to be effective, and in many cases there may be
no border necessary.

<BordersLight />

<BordersDark />

## Input Colors

Inputs that exist within FormFields have varying colors to
suggest their state: enabled vs. disabled, required, etc. The
proper use of these colors ensures that the user can easily
understand the state of the input.

### Input Palette

In light and dark modes, input colors are key in providing the
user with guidance on how they can interact with an input.

<InputsLight />
<br />
<InputsDark />

## Text colors

Text needs to be legible in all contexts. Ensuring high contrast
is met for accessibility and readability is important to
delivering users a consistent reading experience throughout HPE.


### Text Color Palette

Text colors have two states when working on different background
contexts; depending on background the text can invert to
accomodate a dark mode. To ensure text maintains readability, we
avoid color use with the exception of call to actions such as
hyperlinks and anchors.

## Status Colors

## Focus Color

Focus is critical to accessibility. When a user is navigating
with keyboard, focus indicates which element on the page is
active. Do not remove focus outline in your application, as this
will compromise the accessibility of the application.

<FocusColor />

## Elevation

Elevation creates depth between a foreground and background
element. Depending on the desired contrast, varying strengths of
elevation can be used. Elevation is implemented by default on
certain elements such as 
[Menu](/components/menu) and [Select](/components/select).

<ElevationLight />
<br />
<ElevationDark />

## Overlay Color

When a [Layer](/components/layer) is
open, this overlay extends over the rest of the application
content. It creates a visual distinction between the active
foreground Layer and the inactive background content. This is
controlled by `layer.overlay.background` in the theme.

<Overlay />

## Graph Colors

Graph colors should be applied in order, starting with `graph-0` <ColorSwatch background="graph-0" />.
This color order was selected to provide clear distinction
between adjacent data. When using Grommet DataChart, graph
colors will be applied in order by default.
